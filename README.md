To playtest the game, click on the tags under the "Releases" section, then click on the most recent tag, click on the "playable-build-0.2.1-win.zip" to download a compressed/zipped folder, go into the folder (extract everything if needed or if come across an error), and run the "Knightmare Rush.exe" application.  

# Project Overview
We will be creating a 3D Unity boss rush game that will somewhat resemble a Soulslike game, but with just the boss fights. The game will take place in a medieval fantasy-like environment. 

# Roles
Mike - enemy design. This includes enemy flowcharts, state machines, animations, and attacks   

Michael - enemy design / environment design  
  
Azmain - user interface. These components will include the title screen, HUD (in-game menus (pause menu, settings/options))  
  
Kevin - player functionalities. This will include player design (appearance), movement (simple movement, dodging, attacking), states/interactions (intangibility during roll, taking damage, death), weapon functionality (how player and boss will interact with weapon, animations)
